                I.S. Law Firm has expertise in all areas of immigration law. Our experience has
                taught us that working closely with our clients throughout the immigration process
                is essential to avoiding mistakes and ensuring the successful completion of their
                applications as quickly as possible. Immigration is one of the most complicated
                areas of law in the United States, in part because the laws and regulations
                governing it are constantly evolving. Minor mistakes in the application process can
                lead to delays, extra costs, and other unfavorable consequences. While some firms
                use the same forms and procedures for all clients, we treat our clients as
                individuals and take the time to carefully evaluate the specific laws that apply to
                each

              case. Not only do we take a unique, client-by-client approach to immigration cases,
              but we do so for a competitive, reasonable rate. We understand that immigration
              process could be complex and time consuming, this is why we strive to make the
              procedure for our clients easy and simple to understand. We will explain your options,
              tell you what we can do, how much it will cost, and dedicate all our resources,
              knowledge and skills to win your case. You can be assured that your case will be
              evaluated with thorough detail and attention to achieve the best possible outcome. We
              will work hard to provide you with clear and relevant information on your case so you
              can be confident in our expertise as well as the choices we make while trying to
